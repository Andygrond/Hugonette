# Hugonette
If you need a PHP micro-framework to easily enliven your static site, try Hugonette. 

I choose Hugo generator as my tool for preparing page design and functionality. It's main advangate for me is really fast response for change. So when I change any html or css in my project, or debugging js file, I can check it in my browser immediately on localhost:1313. But as a result Hugo generates a static page, where all files are ready exactly as you see it while browsing.

You can help yourself with some easy tasks as mailbox on page, using external service, or hosting your files on Netlify. But when you see that your site can't be static anymore, and you prefer to use your LAMP hosting, here is the solution! Equipped with awesome Nette templating engine and Tracy debugging tool you can solve more complex demands.

The library is in test phase now. Return here in December.
