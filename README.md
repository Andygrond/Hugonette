# Hugonette
If you need a PHP framework to easily enliven your static site, try Hugonette. 

I choose Hugo generator as my tool for making page design. It's main advangate for me is really fast response for change in my project. So when I make a change in any html or css, or debugging js file, I see it it my browser immediately on localhost:1313. But as a result Hugo generates a static page, where all files are ready exactly as you see it while browsing.

You can help yourself with some easy tasks as mailbox on page, using external service, or placing your files on Netlify. But when you see that your site can't be static anymore, and you prefer to use your LAMP hosting, here is the solution! Equipped with awesome Nette templating engine and Tracy debugging tool you can solve more complex problems.

The library is in test phase now. Return here in December.
